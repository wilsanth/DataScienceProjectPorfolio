## General Information
Data is used from the Kaggle data set listed below. We first go through and evaluate the data and clean it. 
We then do some oversampling because the data is imbalanced.
We then used several different models to try and predict strokes in patients supplied in the dataset. 
## Technologies
 * Python 3.7
## Python Libraries
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* statsmodels
* imblearn
* scipy
## Files
* EDA - Predictive Analysis - Strokes.ipynb: Coding file to evaluate, clean, and predict the outcome
* Predictive Analysis - Strokes.pdf: Final report
