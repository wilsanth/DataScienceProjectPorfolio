## General Information
The program requests the user's city or zip code to return the weather forecast. It will produce the current forecast as well as two graphs. The first graph displays the temperatures, and the second will show precipitation (humidity, snow, and rainfall)
## Technologies
* Python 3.6
## Python Libraries
* requests
* matplotlib
* datetime
## Files
* Getting Weather By City: coding file
## Future Enhancements
* Add latitude and longitude coordinates for updated OpenWeatherMap requirements. We need to convert the city and zip code to geocoordinates.
* Add API JSON file and create a function to call the API key. This would offer better security and allow the API to be flexible.
