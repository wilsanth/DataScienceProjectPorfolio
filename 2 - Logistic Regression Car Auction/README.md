## General Information
This is my first data science project where R studio was used to create a document with the code in markdown. This can be a good reference for those just starting to help answer fundamental questions as they navigate their first project. 

This program outlines the steps of a data science project in four steps: <br>
1. Getting Started
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Starting Writeups
4. Report

#### 1. Getting Started
Beginning project questions are asked about gathering the data and the project's approach.
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Guided questions are given to help navigate the data and understand what is happening at a high level. The intent is to get the data ready for the model.
#### 3. Starting Writeups
Questions are asked to try and think of things that still need to be uncovered and how the model can be used in the future.
#### 4. Report
The final paper is written in this section. This is where we would send a report out to our business partners and colleagues on our findings.
