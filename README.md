# Anthony Wilson Data Science Portfolio
## Project List
1 - [OpenWeatetherMap API Call](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/1%20-%20OpenWeatether%20API%20Call)
This is used to show basic programming skills to call an API and return data.This is used to show basic programming skills to call an API and return data.

2 - [Logistic Regression Car Auction](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/2%20-%20Logistic%20Regression%20Car%20Auction)
This I am wanting to display my ability to code in R and show case the start of my data science skills. This combines writing code and my thought process as I work through my project.The project shows the thought process behind a data science project. It is done in R where coding and mark down can be done together, and the final paper and code are in the same file.

3 - [EDA Tornadoes](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/3%20-%20EDA%20Tornadoes)
This is a good project showing my skills to look into the data deeper and analyzing it. I am not only looking at all the data but also taking a step back and looking at by year, and taking the mean. The EDA Tornado project looks deeper into the data. It looks at the granular data provided, but the project also takes a step back and aggregates the data by year. This presents new ways to look at data from a holistic perspective.

4 - [Covid- WHO Hygiene Coverage, Google Webscrape & Covid API Call](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/4%20-%20Covid-%20WHO%20Hygiene%2C%20Google%20Webscrape%20%26%20Covid%20API%20Call)
The Covid- WHO Hygiene Coverage, Google Web Scrape & Covid API Call project combines several projects into one. The main approach of the project is to bring multiple sources of data together and create a database. The other major part of the project looks at every country from the covid API data and does a google news search and stores the top ten results. A web scrape is done for each of the ten results for each country. The web scrape is looking for specific words and storing the results in the database. The final part of the project brings the multiple sources together to trying and find covid trends.

5 - [Decision Tree](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/5%20-%20Decision%20Tree)
The decision tree project is creating the logic from scratch to build a decision tree. The iris data is used to test the model.

6 - [Naive Bayes - First Event in Hockey Game](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/6%20-%20Naive%20Bayes%20-%20First%20Event%20in%20Hockey%20Game)
The naïve bayes project uses supervised models to try and understand hockey data. The goal of the project is to see if teams that are the first to react offensively/defensively have a higher chance of winning the game.This displays my ability to gather data and think outside of the box and look for different ways analyze and the data.

7 - [Predicting Analysis Stroke](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/7%20-%20Predicting%20Analysis%20Strokes)
The stroke analysis displays some more supervised models. It focuses on healthcare-related conditions. Data science is important to the healthcare industry and has the opportunity to save lives.The stroke analysis displays some more complex models than the simple one. I thought this was good for focusing on more complex problems. There is a lot of focus in predicting diseases, and I have been interested in healthcare data.

8 - [XGBoost Digital Game-Based Learning](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/8%20-%20Digital%20Game%20Based%20Learning)
The XGBoost, is one of the more popular models, especially on competition websites. The data used is great, because it shows everything a user does in the Jo Wilder game. The data looks to be similar to live data, that one would be expected to create a model for in the business world. The model is intended to predict the user’s answers.

9 - [Random Forest Hotel Cancelation](https://github.com/wilsanth/DataScienceProjectPorfolio/tree/main/9%20-%20Hotel%20Reservations)
The Random Forest Hotel Cancelation is a project that could come in high demand for near real time results. The data provided has basic information about the reservation, and the hotel. The model is intended to predict whether the reservation is retained or cancelled.
